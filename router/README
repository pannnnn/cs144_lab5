Following the pseudo code for sending a arp request when the difference in 
time is greater than 1, resulted the tests for host unreachable to fail. 
A solution we came up was changing the difference time to be greater or equal 
to one. If in some point if the tests fail for host unreachable, please 
consider to change the time difference a value in the in range that is less 
than one.
